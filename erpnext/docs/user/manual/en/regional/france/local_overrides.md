# Sales and Payment Transactions

In order to be compliant with the latest finance law applicable to POS software, ERPNext automatically registers all sales and payment transactions in a chained log.

If your country is set to "France", the deletion of sales and payment transactions will also not be permitted, even if the appropriate permissions are given to the user.

Please note that ERPNext is not yet fully compliant with the 2016 Finance Law.
